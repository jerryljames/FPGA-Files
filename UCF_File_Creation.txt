Specifying Timing Constraints in Your UCF File
For most embedded processor designs, you need only specify the input (reference) clock period to ensure that your system meets performance requirements. In some cases, your design might contain off-chip peripherals, such as memory controllers, that have particular input and output timing requirements. The following are typical of the basic timing constraints you must provide in your UCF file:
Syntax: Net <clock_port> PERIOD = <value>;
Example: Net sys_clk_pin PERIOD = 20000 ps;


Specifying Pin Constraints for External Ports
You must often provide a Location (LOC) constraint to define the FPGA pin location for each external port. To view the list of the external ports, do the following:
 In the XPS Main Window, click the System Assembly View tab to show the System Assembly window.
 Click the Ports tab.
What to Expect
LOC constraints take the following form:
Syntax: NET <port_name> LOC=<pin_number>;
Example: NET RS232_RX_pin LOC=U4;
